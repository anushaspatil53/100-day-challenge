- Cybersecurity developed as a distinct field throughout the 1960s and 70s and exploded into the 
  public consciousness in the late 1980s.
- An early instance of hacking in 1963 involved hacking a phone system to make long-distance calls for free.
- Hacking is the act of working within the confines of a system to produce unintended behavior.
- That behavior ranges from cracking passwords to saving a spaceship’s air system using spare parts.

1960’s
- In 60's there is increase in connectivity, computing time was expensive. The solution of protecting accounts with passwords has persisted.

1970’s
- The creation of ARPANET, the earliest form of the internet. It was a testing ground for new technologies.
- There were a few adventures into the development of malware (short for malicious software), including Creeper and Reaper, the first computer worms.
-A 1975 paper titled The Protection of Information in Computer Systems presented principles and concepts that would become critical to cybersecurity in the future.

1980’s
- the Internet was formed in 1983, and the adoption of the Internet Protocol Suite by ARPANET and other networks.
- Era of cold war 
-Tools and techniques developed during this era in cybersecurity, dictionary attacks used stolen lists of passwords and exploited weak default credentials, while decoy computer systems trapped attackers.
   80’s major events
    -Hacker working for the KGB gained access to sensitive documents from the U.S. military.
    -Morris Worm : choking computers with multiple copies of itself, and clogging the network as it kept replicating.

1990’s
- Era of viruses 
- Many computers that connected to the internet became common in household.
- This led to unskilled script kiddies. They can use that code to launch attacks they don’t understand in order to vandalize or destroy targets for fun.

2000’s
- Data became digitized particularly to monetary transactions.
- Credit-card breaches, hacktivism, and holding corporations’ systems for ransom became increased.
- Companies started considering security seriously as it could lead to extended downtime, loss of customer loyalty, lawsuits, and fines from regulatory bodies.

2010’s
- Malicious hacker groups targeted major corporations and government organizations, stealing data and launching ransomware attacks.
- Most dangerous threat actors are Advanced Persistent Threats. APTs are capable of running entire cyber-campaigns, attempting to infiltrate their target across multiple domains simultaneously.
- WannaCry and NotPetya caused global damage.

Present Day
- Attacks on computers can disrupt transportation, power, economy, healthcare, communication, and even lives.
- Airlines, hospitals and people’s computers were affected after CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity company, sent out a flawed software update.
